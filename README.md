# Tutorial for AI Integration Project

## Notes
- Answers to the questions are written on top of the notebooks.
- The latest and updates notebooks are saved in kaggle-notebooks directory. 
- Files in local-notebooks directory were run locally but was not continued due to PC memory limitations.
- There are still problems with models:
  - VGG16 model has low accuracy (~50%) for training, validation, and testing.
  - MobileNet model have good accuracy for training and validation (~100%) but worse accuracy during testing (bad result based on confusion matrix, excellent numerical accuracy).



## TODOs
- flask deployment
- fix problems with models
- clean notebooks contents
- push output models via Git LFS
